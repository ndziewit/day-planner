# Day Planner

This application uses HTML, CSS, and jQuery to make a simple workday planner. Times in the past are red, current hour is highlighted, and future hours are green. You can click in the center box to add text and then the button to the right to save whatever you entered. All entries are saved to local storage so you can access them even after the page is closed.
